TEAM CIAA
Group 3
Ikram ZAKARIA, Chris de Wardt, Aya Zalzala


I Notes:
We started the exercise by first understanding what the data was about and how it was split. Then we tried to organize ourselves to implement it in DataBeaver. 
Below are a few comments on what we found:
* Some columns were duplicated (gender)
* Column names were a bit confusing and not adapted to the database 
* Column ID had duplicates, we were given another document afterwards


The changes we made:
* Adapted data column name: underscores for spaces/dashes, removed multiple line headers
